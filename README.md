**Disclaimer**: This repository was created in the framework of the course 'Projet Recherche' from the M1 Applied Mathematics (Université Paris-Saclay) / diplome ingénieur (ENSIIE), with equal contributions from Qian LIU and Angie MÉNDEZ LLANOS. we had the guidance of Sergio PULIDO, associate professor at the ENSIIE.  

This projet consists in understanding and replicating the results of the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-019-0066-7).

The project was carried out using Google Colab to benefit from the use of GPUs.

The **data** folder contains our generated data. The data was generated in chunks and the joined in a single file due to computational limitations.
The **results** folder contains our trained models, which can be loaded into a notebook to make predictions, and csv files containing the trainign history and the evaluation on the test data.
